# Mobile Flashcards Project

## Overview

Mobile Flashcards is an app to help you study. You can create multiple decks of cards and
then quiz yourself as often as you'd like.

### Home

On the home screen you are presented with a list of the decks you have created. You can
select a deck to quiz yourself, add a new deck, or clear all the decks you have saved.

### Add a Deck

On this page, you will enter the title of the deck you want to add. Once you save it
you will be redirected to that deck so you can start adding cards.

### Deck Details

On the deck details screen, you can see how many cards that deck has. You can also add cards
to the deck, or start quizzing yourself.

### Add a Card

On this page, you can add a card with a question and answer. This card will be added to
the deck so it will be included in the quiz for that deck.

### Quiz

When you quiz yourself, you can see your progress in the top left corner. You can also toggle
between the question and answer by hitting the Question/Answer button below the quiz text.
If you got the question right, hit the "Correct" button and it will add one point to your
score and move on to the next question. If you did not get it right, hit the "Incorrect" button.
It will move onto the next question without adding any points. Once you complete the quiz
you will see your score, and you will have the option to restart the quiz or go back to the deck
details.

### Notifications

If you have not completed a quiz by 6pm you will receive a notification reminding you to quiz
yourself. If you complete a quiz, the notification will be disabled for that day.
